legacy-use connects to your target like a humand coworker via:

- VNC (most common) - for any desktop application
- RDP - for Windows Remote Desktop
- Remote Desktop Software - for TeamViewer or RustDesk

## Step 3: Your First Automation

Let's Automate the Windows Calculator
We'll create a simple workflow that adds two numbers using the Windows Calculator - a perfect first automation!

### Create New Workflow

Navigate to API/Workflows â†’ Create New
Choose Template: "Windows Calculator" (or start from scratch)
Name your workflow: "Add Two Numbers"
Select your target: Choose the Windows computer you connected

### Define Your Workflow

Workflow Details
```
Name: Add Two Numbers
Description: Uses Windows Calculator to add two numbers and return the result
```

Input Parameters
```
first_number (integer): First number to add (default: 10)
second_number (integer): Second number to add (default: 5)
```

Instructions for AI
```
I need to add {{first_number}} and {{second_number}} using the Windows Calculator.

Steps:
1. Look for the Calculator app on screen - it should be visible
2. If not visible, press Windows key and type "calculator" then press Enter
3. Wait for Calculator to open
4. Click the "C" button to clear any previous calculations
5. Type the first number: {{first_number}}
6. Click the "+" button
7. Type the second number: {{second_number}}
8. Click the "=" button
9. Read the result from the display and return it
```

Expected Output
```json
{
  "result": 15,
  "calculation": "10 + 5 = 15"
}
```

### Test Your Workflow

Click "Test Workflow"
Set test values:

first_number: 12
second_number: 8

Watch the magic happen:

You'll see a live video feed of your target
Watch as the AI opens Calculator
See it perform the calculation
Get the structured result back
