legacy-use automates work in desktop applications (any OS) and enables easy integration (APIs).

Build and integrate faster without limits through reliable user interface automation paired with powerful AI reasoning.

It uses computer vision and AI to click, type, and navigate just like a human — handling pop-ups, slow load times, and complex forms without breaking. All tools for running, monitoring, and scaling automations are built in. The platform is open, extensible, and built to replace fragile RPA with reliable desktop automation.

1. No installation needed. Works on any desktop and legacy app (Windows, macOS, Linux, ...), no special setup required, only remote desktop access.
2. Write your workflow. Describe it in plain English (“Open SAP, create invoice…”) or show a demo — AI vision understands the UI.
3. Access modern APIs. All workflows are accessible through modern JSON REST api, integrates with other automation software, and built in API docs.
