> legacy-use automates work in desktop applications and exposes workflows as modern APIs.

Powered by computer vision and AI reasoning, it interacts with software like a human — clicking, typing, and navigating through pop-ups, delays, and complex forms without breaking. Unlike fragile RPA, it’s reliable, scalable, and comes with built-in tools for monitoring and orchestration.

1. **Zero setup** – Works with Windows, macOS, or Linux apps via remote access, no installation required.
2. **Natural workflow design** – Describe steps in plain English (“Open SAP, create invoice…”), record a demo or teach with onboarding documents.
3. **Seamless integration** – Every workflow is accessible via JSON REST APIs with built-in documentation.

Build and integrate faster without limits through reliable user interface automation paired with powerful AI reasoning.
